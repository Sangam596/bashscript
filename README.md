Practicing Bash Shell Scripting for automation

# What is shell script?
Shell scripting is a method for automating tasks on a computer. It is done by creating a text file that contains a series of commands.

The file is then saved with a .sh extension and can be executed by running the command "./script_name.sh"

There are many different shells that can be used for scripting, but the most popular is Bash. Bash is available on most Unix-based operating systems, including Linux and macOS.

# Here are some of the benefits of using shell scripting:
